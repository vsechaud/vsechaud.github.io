I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at [ENS de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/), supervised by [Julián Tachella](https://tachella.github.io/) and [Patrice Abry](https://www.ens-lyon.fr/PHYSIQUE/presentation/annuaire/abry-patrice). I’m working on inverse problems and machine learning, particularly, I study theory and algorithms for self-supervised learning methods for non-linear problems like phase retrieval and declipping.  
Alongside my PhD, I gave undergraduate courses (64 hours per year) in the Mathematics department, covering Linear Algebra, Python, and Statistics.
