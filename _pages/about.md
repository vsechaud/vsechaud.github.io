I am a PhD student in Applied Mathematics at [ENS de Lyon](http://www.ens-lyon.fr/). I work on inverse problems and machine learning, particularly in studying self-supervised learning methods for the phase retrieval problem. 

`_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
